## API Endpoints
    The app communicates with the backend using the following API endpoints:

    GET /journal/entries - Retrieve all journal entries.
    POST /journal/entries - Add a new journal entry.
    PUT /journal/entries/:id - Update a journal entry.

## This version explicitly states that the **AI Text Generation** button is visible only when a journal entry is in **Edit** mode. Let me know if youâ€™d like further adjustments!
